# Muslims are assumed to use the iqta government and jizya tax, which make them ineligible to the features of this mod.
# If a Muslim group religion lacks either or both of these, register them by adding NOT clauses to the following triggers.

cns_religion_uses_iqta = {  # Adding an exception makes Non-Clerical available as a doctrine choice.
	religion_group = muslim
}

cns_religion_uses_jizya = {  # Adding an exception enables secular government if already clergyless and Cosmopolitan.
