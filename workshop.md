# Church and State: Non-Clerical and Pluralist Governments

**Adds new government types with features that are Iqta-like and/or encourage religious pluralism**

This mod provides the following **game rules**:

 - Non-clerical governments can be enabled for a list of religions, by doctrine, or both.
 - The Pluralist Feudal and Imperial governments can be enabled for Cosmopolitan religions.
 - Hafiz-like traits can be enabled for clergyless religions or all religions.

***Localised in English and French.***


## Pluralist Governments

The **Pluralist Feudal** government is used by Cosmopolitan Temporal heads and kings with the top-tier Crowned trait. It eliminates religious opinion penalties between liege and vassal.

Cosmopolitan emperors can adopt **Pluralist Imperialism** by decision, which combines the above features with those associated with Imperial governments.

By default, **both** of these government types are enabled. Generally intended for top lieges, they will override most other types, including non-clerical ones (see below).


## Non-Clerical Governments

The **Pious Feudal** government type is available to non-clerical religions. Like Iqta for Muslims, it effectively replaces the Feudal and Theocracy governments, allowing rulers to hold both Castles and Temples.

Cosmopolitan, non-clerical religions may use the **Secular Feudal** government instead, which also removes religious opinion penalties between liege and vassal.

By default, there are **two** ways for a religion to be non-clerical:

 - Through reformation, with the Non-Clerical doctrine. Random Worlds can also be set up to use it, or not, as random feature.
 - Statically: the Lollard, Waldensian, Paulician, Jewish and Karaite religions are treated as non-clerical as long as they do *not* use random features.


## Non-Clerical Advisor

Religions with the Non-Clerical doctrine, but *not* those that are statically defined as clergyless, unlock an additional council seat.

The religion's nature determines the title of this advisor. They must be suited for a religious position, except for cosmopolitan Delegates, who need to follow a different faith instead.

New events will be added in the future for each type of advisor.


## Guardians of Scripture

The Hafiz trait is now available to non-Muslim religions, renamed as "Guardian of [Religion's scripture]". Its effects have also been improved:

 - For Muslims, +5 religion opinion and +0.5 piety/month
 - For Christians and Israelites, +5 religion and +5 group opinion
 - For others, including all randomly renamed religions, +10 religion opinion

By default, this feature is enabled for **clergyless religions**, including randomized Muslims.


## Compatibility

This mod does not replace any file from the main game. It should be compatible with future versions as well as most other mods.

Mods that add new government types or rely on landed priests may require a compatibility patch. See the [README](https://github.com/Murdim/church_and_state/blob/master/README.md) for more details.
